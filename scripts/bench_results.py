"""Turn a benchmark run into the published results document.

Three runs feed one document, `docs/benchmarks/results.json`, which the documentation site serves
at `benchmarks/results.json`. Each run writes its own section and keeps the sections the others
wrote.

The default reads the summary `benches/paired.rs` writes: the wall-clock comparison of every
scenario, raw sqlx loop against service, and the one field of the environment only the run can
know, the statement round trip it measured against the database. This script adds the machine,
the build and the versions the run was taken against. The schema is the core's, declared at
https://powersemmi.github.io/ruststream/latest/benchmarks/#publishing-results: schema 3, each
loop as its best, median and worst round. A scenario carries the raw loop, the crate's own
subscription or publisher driven by hand (`adapter`), and the service, and `broker_bound` where
the raw loop spent most of its time waiting on the database. An outbox row (`plugin`) carries one
app in three variants in the same places: no outbox, the outbox written by hand, this crate's
outbox, with `plugin_overhead_percent` for the last against the second.

`--throughput` reads the summary `benches/throughput.rs` writes and keeps it as the
`throughput` section: messages per second for a filled table drained on Postgres, MySQL and
SQLite, single deliveries and batches, at each worker count, for the raw loop, the crate driven by
hand and the service with the same concurrency; and the outbox's tracked round trips over Redis
Pub/Sub in its three variants.

`--code` reads the summary `cargo bench -- --output-format=json` writes for the code-cost benches
under `crates/ruststream-sqlx-bench/benches`, one JSON object per benchmark, in the summary layout
gungraun 0.20 writes (its version 7). It writes the `code` section: one entry per scenario with
the service's instructions and allocations per message (`framework`), the raw loop's beside them
(`raw`), and what starting the service cost once (`cold`); an outbox row (`plugin`) counts its
app with no outbox as `raw`, with the outbox written by hand as `adapter`, and with this crate's
outbox as `framework`. The method is the core's: every scenario is measured over one delivery,
over MESSAGES and over twice MESSAGES, the slope between the last two is the steady
state, and the one-delivery run is the cold start. MESSAGES is 1000 unless `--messages` names the
count the benches were built with. The section carries its own provenance in `code_measured`,
because the wall-clock sections beside it may come from another run, on another version, on
another day; every run keeps what the others wrote.

A code run that breaches one of its limits fails, and in this output format the runner says
nothing more about it: what went over is recorded in the summary alone. So every breach is printed
under the table, the value the run was compared against next to the new one, and a summary that
cannot be converted still prints its breaches before it stops.

A field the machine does not publish is written as `unknown` rather than guessed: memory speed
comes from the DMI tables, which most systems only let root read.
